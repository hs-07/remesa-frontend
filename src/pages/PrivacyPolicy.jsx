          consent to the international transfer of information about you to the
          above parties. The most common reason for us disclosing information
          overseas is because we use service providers to perform some functions
          on our behalf, and some of these service providers are located outside
          the European Economic Area (EEA). We only disclose information to
          these organisations when it is necessary for the services they provide

          to us which perform a range of technology and operational functions
          for us.
